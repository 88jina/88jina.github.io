## 불필요한 유통구조를 날려버린 농산물 직거래 서비스

Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Meh. So, how 'bout them Knicks? Also Zoidberg.

1. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
2. Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
3. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?

### Why not indeed!

Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Soothe us with sweet lies. Bender?! You stole the atom. You don't know how to do any of those.

* Shinier than yours, meatbag.
* This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.
* Ooh, name it after me!
